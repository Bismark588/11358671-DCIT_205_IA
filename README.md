## Introduction
Welcome to the Computer Science Department project! This project serves as a website design by a beginner developer to suit the University of Ghana Computer Science Department with the aim of improving developing skills and striving towards becoming a future world-class website developer.

## Purpose Of Website
This website is developed to acquire good developing skills and to showcase what has been learned in the course so far and the progress being made.

## Cloning and Setup

## Lessons Learned
- Indeed, I have learned many lessons. At first, I knew nothing about website development, but now I have learned a lot: from "marquee" text to inserting videos on the website. Initially, I was puzzled about these features, but through research and practice, I gained a lot of experience in them.
- Cloning the project at the beginning was challenging for me, but watching YouTube videos and conducting research helped me resolve it. Also, inserting screenshots in the README.md document was challenging, but again, research and videos assisted me.
- Regarding the Official Department of Computer Science Website, I suggest that the "YOUR GATEWAY TO WORLD CLASS COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION" text should either be a marquee or have an alternative option since it might block some users' views while watching videos.

## Conclusion
Thank you for choosing this project! I hope it provides value and insight, making navigation through the website easy.
