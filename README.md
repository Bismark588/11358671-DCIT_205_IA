        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Indeed I have learn many Lessons, I did not Know anything about website learn a whole lot, how to "marquee" text and a whole lot, Insertion of video on the in website is a whole lot to me, at first I was thinking how do they do it but now hear am I with a lot of experience in it.</li>
            <li>Cloning at the beginning of the project was a whole lot to me but watching Youtube videos and a lot of research helped me to resolved it and also Insertion of sreenshots in the README.md documentwas also taugh, but in all researchand videos helped me.</li>
            <li>Concerning the Official Department of Computer Science Website I suggest that the "YOUR GATEWAY TO WORLD CLASS COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION" should either be marquee or any other option because some clint may like to watch the video, but hereby that block thier views.</li>
        </ul>
